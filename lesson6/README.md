# Lesson 6: Lights

## Photons as Particles

![Photons as Particles](./img/photons-as-particles.png)

* Each light or "*emitter*" sends photons out
* Each photon is absorbed or reflected
  * Every object absorbs some light (even highest quality mirrors)
* Along the way photons can be absorbed by dust, water droplets, or other particles in the air.

This simple photon model ignores various effects such as:

* polarization
* and fluorescence
